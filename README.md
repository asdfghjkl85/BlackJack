Blackjack Simulator

Welcome to the Blackjack simulator designed for players looking to sharpen their skills in card counting! This project aims to provide a learning environment where newer players can understand the fundamentals of card counting, while experienced users can enjoy a dynamic and customizable Blackjack experience.

Features
Card Counting Mechanics:

Running Count
True Count
Decks Remaining
Bet Size and Action Recommendations:

Based on the current count, the system will suggest appropriate bet sizes and player actions.
Data Structure and Algorithm Exploration:

Unique implementation of card counting and game logic using advanced data structures and algorithms for efficient computation.
Modular Design:

Designed with flexibility, allowing you to experiment with different strategies and rules.
Planned Features
Visual Representation:
A future update may include a graphical interface to visually simulate card counting and gameplay.
Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment:
As players improve, the game will offer adaptive challenges to maintain engagement and learning growth.
Learning Card Counting
Card counting is a strategy used to determine the likelihood of favorable cards being dealt. By tracking the cards as they are played, the player gains an edge by adjusting bets and actions according to the remaining deck composition. In this simulator, we focus on teaching the following:

Running Count: Tracks the count as cards are revealed.
True Count: Adjusts the running count by factoring in the number of remaining decks.
Decks Remaining: Keeps track of how many decks are left, aiding in calculating the true count.
The combination of these metrics helps determine optimal betting and gameplay decisions in real-time.

How the Simulation Works
Gameplay:

Play against a dealer with traditional Blackjack rules.
The system tracks the cards dealt and updates the running and true count.
Card Counting Strategy:

As cards are dealt, the running count is incremented or decremented based on card values.
The true count adjusts based on the number of decks remaining in play.
Bet and Action Suggestions:

Depending on the true count, the simulator provides recommendations for betting and whether to hit, stand, split, or double down.
Technical Implementation
The project is built using Java, and we aim to experiment with different data structures and algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of card tracking. Future updates may include a more visual and interactive experience as we explore new ways to represent card counts and gameplay flow.

Future Directions:
Implement visual aids and graphical interfaces.
Expand data structure use and algorithm complexity for deeper gameplay analysis.
Add more flexible gameplay rules, multiplayer mode, and advanced learning modes.
